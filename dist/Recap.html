        <ul>
            <li>Back in February, there was a heated conversation</li>
            <li>He offered and she took him up on it about 45 minutes later</li>
            <li>It was officially set for April 23rd at the courthouse</li>
            <li>COVID-19 happened and things got delayed</li>
            <li>When things opened back up, courthouse wasn't doing weddings yet</li>
            <li>She contacted her coworker, Christiana about officiating</li>
            <li>They got the certificate two weeks before</li>
            <li>Christiana came over with her husband Meet (he's Indian)</li>
            <li>They fished</li>
            <li>They grilled out</li>
            <li>They signed the paperwork</li>
            <li>Had awesome banana pudding for dessert</li>
            <li>Turned in certificate that Monday</li>
            <li>The end</li>
